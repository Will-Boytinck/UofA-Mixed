shaping: successive approximations of the target behaviour
behaviours are not
quantitative shaping: setting criteria to increase (or decrease) a dimension of an existing behaviour
qualitative shaping: degree to which successive behaviours resemble the target behaviour

Prompting: giving stimuli before (or during) performance of a behaviour to increase the likelihood that a person will engage in the target behaviour at the correct time

Types of prompts:
- response prompt: behaviour of another person that evokes the target behaviour from the target person when the sD is also present
	verbal prompt: hints, instructions, commands
	gestural prompt: physical movements that indicate how, where or what behaviour to 	preform
	modeling prompt: demonstrating the target behaviour
	physical guidance propmpt: another person physically assits
	three-step prompting: use prompts progressively (verbal --> modeling --> physical)
stimulus prompt: sD is changed, or simulus is added or removed to encourage target behaviour
	within-stimulus prompt: involves changing the sD
	extra-stimulus prompt: involves adding a stimulus to the sD
	picture-prompt: photos
	auditory prompt: sounds
	environmental prompts: alterations or additions to the physical surroundings

transfer of stimulus control: prompts are faded / reduced prompts
response prompt fading: response prompt is gradually lessened
	fading within prompt: same prompt is used but is decreased in magnitude or intensity
	graduated guidance: gradually reducing physical guidance
	shadowing: follows learners movement without contact
	prompt delay: wait a certain number of seconds and if the target behaviour does not 	occur, provide the prompt

behavioural chain: complex behaviour comprised of several component behaviours that occur in a certain order
	-suitable for tasks that are not overly long or complex
	- not appropriate for people with developmental disabilities
backward chaining - start with the last link
	- typically used with learners who have limited abilities
	- requires additional preparation by behaviour analyst
forward chaining - start with the first link
	- retains squential order

functional assessment: a set of procedures that allow relationships between a behaviour and its antecedents to be determined

indirect methods: data on actecedents, behaviours, consequences are collected from the target person / others based on their memory

direct observation methods: as the behaviour occurs in its natural environment
	unstructured: naturalistic observations
	structured: systematic manipulation
	- pros: do not rely on fallibe memory
	- cons: involds more work

experimental methods (functional analysis): an experimenter systematically manipulates antecedents and consequences to determine their effect on the target behaviour

differential reinforcement: one particular behaviour is reinforced whereas all others are not
 
differential reinforment of alternative behaviour (DRA): undesirable behaviour is no longer reinforced and alternative behaviour is reinforced
differential reinforcement of incompatible behaviour: undesirable behaviour is extinguished and a behaviour that cant be done at the same time as the undesirable behaviour is reinforced
differential reinforcement of other behaviour: undesirable behaviour is extinguished, and a reinforcer is delivered after a period of time in which the behaviour does not occur
	whole interval DRO: reinforcer delivered if problem behaviour is absent during the
	entire interval
	momentary DRO: reinforcer delivered if problem behaviour is absent at the end of the 	
	interval

Antecedent control procedures: antecedent stimuli are manipulated to evoke desirable behaviours that can be differentially reinforced
1. presenting, modifying or developing new sD for desirable behaviour (seatbelts comic)
2. presenting EO for desirable behaviour
3. decreasing response effort for desirable behaviour (make it easier to do behaviour) -- (paper in trash)
4. removing or modifying existing sD for undesirable behaviour (dog jumping)
5. presenting AO for undesirable behaviour
6. Increasing response effort for undesirable behaviour (kitchen safe)
Note: sD indicates that reinforment follows behaviour
7. noncontingent reinforcement: a form of antecedent intervention in which known reinforcers are given for free (dimishes undesirable behaviour.. passively?)
