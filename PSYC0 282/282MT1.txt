Methods
-------
1. Screening or intake phase: obtain client information, and readons for seeking assistance
2. baseline phase: define and measure initial level of behaviour
3. treatment phase
4. follow-up phase

How is behaviour recorded?
1. Direct assessment: recorded as it occurs
2. indirect assessment: based on second-hand remembered information

When are observations made?
1. Continuous recording: record every instance of client's behaviour during the entire observation period
:pros/cons
- provides actual measure of behaviour 
- well suited to self-monitoring
- very labour intensive
2. Intverval recording: recording target behaviour within successive time intervals
:pros/cons
- less demanding than continuous recording
- less sensitive to true occurence of behaviour
3. Time sample recording: record behaviour during brief intervals separated from each other
:pros/cons
- easiest to record
- more subject to sampling error 

Thorndike's Law of effect
- behaviour followed by pleasant consequences is more likely to occur again in that situation

Operatant: a behaviour that operates on the environment 
Operatant Conditioning: entails manipulating consequences of behaviour 


positive reinforcement - presentation of a pleasant stimulus increases behaviour
	
negative reinforcement - removal of a aversive stimulus increases behaviour

positive punishment - presentation of an aversive stimulus decreases behaviour
	application of aversive activities: requires the individual to do aversive activity
	application of aversive stimulation: delivers an aversive stimulus
negative punishment - removal of an pleasant stimulus decreases behaviour
	time-out from positive reinforcement: removes individual from reinforcing environment
	response cost: punishes behaviour by taking away a valued item

	


escape behaviour: removing an aversive stimulus (you feel cold, put on a sweater)
avoidance behaviour: prevents presentation of an aversive stimulus (put on a sweater before going outside)

Types of reinforcement
---------------------
natural reinforcement: occurs naturally
programmed reinforcement: planned and systematic

social reinforcement: involves another person to deliver reinforcement
automatic reinforcement: gets reinforcement from the environment


tangible reinforcement: access to a preferred object (like a snack)
activity reinforcement: engaging in a preferred activity (like video games)
---------------------

Premack principle: a preferred behaviour can serve as positive reinforcement for performing
a less preferred behaviour 


Types of reinforcers
-------------------
Unconditioned (primary) reinforcers: a stimulus that has natural reinforcing effects (food)
Conditioned (secondary) reinforcers: previous neutral stimulus that has become associated with an unconditioned reinforcer (money)

Types of punishers
------------------
Unconditioned (primary) punisher: stimulus that is naturally aversive 
Conditioned (secondary) punisher: previously neutral stimulus that has become associated with an unconditioned punisher (threats)

Skinners Three-term contingency:
"in the presence of a particular antecedent cue or signal (stimulus), a specific behavious
will be followed by a certain consequence



Establishing operation: establishes the effectiveness of reinforcement: (i.e caloric deprivation for food)
Abolishing operation: decreases the effectiveness of reinforcement (fullness for food)

Schedules of reinforcement
--------------------------
Continuous: reinforcement gives for each response
Intermittent: only some responses are reinforced
	- fixed ratio: reinforcer given after a set number of responses
	- variable ratio: reinforcer is given after a random number of responses
Fixed interval: reinforcer given after a certain length of time
Variable Interval: reinforcer given when response occurs after a variable length of time
--------------------------




overt antecedents - stimuli directly observable with your senses 
covert antecedents - internal experiences

immediate antecents - occur right before or overlap with behaviour (i.e fire alarm)
distant antecedents - stimuli that precede the behaviour by a long time; can also affect behaviour for a long time

stimulus control - the extent to which an antecedent stimulus can influence perforamnce of a specific behaviour

stimulus class - related stimuli that have the same effect on behaviour

SD (discriminatory stimulus) ---> R (response) ---> SR (reinforcing stimulus)
S-delta ---> R ---> nothing
---------------------------------------------
respondent behaviours are elicited or controlled by stimuli
Respondent conditioning: entails manipulating stimuli that elicit reflexive responses
conditioned response: response elicited by a conditioned stimulus
trace conditioning: Neutral stimulus presented before the unconditioned stimulus (no overlap)
delay conditioning: onset of neutral stimulus occurs before onset of unconditioned stimulus
simultaneous conditioning: neutral stimulus and unconditioned stimulus are presented at the same time
backward conditioning: unconditioned stimulus presented before neutral stimulus
respondent extinction: repeated presentation of CS without US causes weakening of CR
